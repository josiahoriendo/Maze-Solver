# Maze-Solver
how mCrafted maze solver using DFS, BFS, Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to optimize paths. Utilized object oriented programming to design WeightedGraph and MazeGraph classes, streamlining efficient graph manipulation. Demonstrated problem-solving by handling random weights and maze densities for optimal paths.
